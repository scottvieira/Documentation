<p>An add-on to CORAL Licensing, the Terms Tool enables key stakeholders
such as interlibrary loan staff to view the license terms without
needing direct access to CORAL Licensing. The tool allows authorized
users to retrieve license terms for a specific resource based on an
ISSN or ISBN query. In addition to CORAL Licensing, the Terms Tool
requires the installing site to have either the SFX or
SerialsSolutions openURL resolver (or alternatively any openURL
resolver with an API). The Terms Tool queries the openURL resolver for
a specific ISSN or ISBN, retrieves the list of available providers for
that ISSN/ISBN, and then queries CORAL Licensing for the license terms
for each provider. It is a multi-step process but it all takes place
behind the scenes and results in a seamless easy to use process for
the user.</p>

<div class="section" id="enabling-the-terms-tool">
<span id="enabling-the-terms-tool"></span><h2>Enabling the Terms Tool<a class="headerlink" href="#enabling-the-terms-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of using the Terms Tool begins with the license record
within CORAL Licensing. The first step is for the licensing personnel
to create a license record with completed expressions as in the
following screenshot.</p>
<p>Please note that these are not the actual license terms for Allen
Press journals. This is only a fabricated example. This license record
shows both the Coursepacks and Interlibrary Loan expressions for the
license agreement titled <em>Allen Press Online Journals Terms and
Conditions of Use</em>. There are two important items to note about these
expressions that directly impact the terms tool. The first is that the
expressions are using Display Notes rather than Internal Notes. Each
expression type can be configured within the CORAL Licensing Admin tab
to use either Display or Internal Notes. Only those expressions which
use Display Notes are made available through the Terms Tool. The
second item of note is the presence of the checkbox next to the
expression type. This is the Terms Tool Checkbox. It is used by the
licensing personnel to indicate that the expression is completed and
is ready to be included in the Terms Tool. The action of checking this
box will send out an email to the personnel managing the Terms Tool</p>
<p>alerting them that new license terms are available. The recipients of
this email are configured on the Admin tab of CORAL Licensing. The
following screenshot shows the details of a user entry in CORAL
Licensing. Any user with an email address in the ‘Terms Tool Email’
field will receive the system generated email when the terms tool
checkbox is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapping-license-terms-to-resources">
<span id="mapping-license-terms-to-resources"></span><h2>Mapping License Terms to Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-license-terms-to-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point there is a completed license record showing the terms
for the license agreement <em>Allen Press Online Journals Terms and
Conditions of Use</em>. The next step which needs to be completed is to
identify which journals are covered by this specific license
agreement. This is accomplished using the ‘Terms Tool’ tab on the
license record as in the following screenshot.</p>
<p>The task is to identify which journals are covered by the <em>Allen Press
Online Journals and Conditions of Use</em> license agreement. This is
accomplished by making a connection between the license agreement and
the list of journals as entered in the library’s openURL resolver. In
this example all of the journals that are covered by the terms of the
agreement were activated and entered as a distinct group within the
library’s openURL resolver. In SFX for example this is accomplished by
activating all the journals covered by the agreement within the same
target. The target is then given a target public name of ‘Allen Press’
(serialsolutions calls this field databaseName). Then within the
‘Terms Tool’ tab of CORAL Licensing the link can be entered between
the document <em>Allen Press Online Journals and Conditions of Use</em> and
the SFX target named ‘Allen Press’. The Terms Tool will now know that
all journals available within the Allen Press target are covered by
the terms of this specific license agreement.</p>
<p>The Terms Tool now has the information it needs to operate. The
scenario is as follows. The Terms Tool receives an ISSN via the url
<em>http://.../coral/terms/?issn=XXXX-XXXX</em>. The Terms Tool sends a query
with the provided issn to the library’s openURL resolver. The openURL
resolver returns an xml reply listing all of the provider names (SFX’s
target public name or SerialsSolutions’ databaseName) for the provided
ISSN. The Terms Tool queries CORAL Licensing for all license
agreements which have been mapped to each provider name and retrieves
all of the associated license terms from the identified license
agreements. The terms are then displayed on screen to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terms-tool-in-action">
<span id="terms-tool-in-action"></span><h2>Terms Tool in Action<a class="headerlink" href="#terms-tool-in-action" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows the Terms Tool display for the journal
<em>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</em> (issn 1934-9491).</p>
<p>At this point the Terms Tool has already queried both the openURL
resolver and then CORAL Licensing and identified that Coursepack and
Interlibrary Loan terms are available for this journal. The link for
Interlibrary Loan leads to the following screenshot.</p>
<p>And in the above screenshot the user now sees the specific
interlibrary loan license terms for this journal. Access to this
journal is available via Allen Press and interlibrary loan use is
permitted. The Display Notes from the license record detail how the
interlibrary loan is to be handled. The actual document text from the
license agreement is hidden beneath a ‘view license snippet’ link for
those wishing to see the original language. The provider name at the
end of the opening line is hyperlinked and will take the user directly
to the provider’s webpage for the journal. This example lists only one
provider, Allen Press, but the Terms Tool will display terms for all
providers when the library does have</p>
<p>access through multiple providers. If no license terms are available
for a provider the Terms Tool will show that as well as in the
following example.</p>
<p>Again, please note that the license terms in these screenshots are all
fabricated examples and do not reflect the actual terms of the
provider’s real license agreements. In the preceding screenshot access
is available to the library through multiple providers but license terms
are only available for the BioMed Central access.</p>

<div class="section" id="finding-the-terms-tool">
<span id="finding-the-terms-tool"></span><h2>Finding the Terms Tool<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-the-terms-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Terms Tool is used by querying it with a url containing either an
ISSN or ISBN such as
<a class="reference external" href="http://coral.mylibrary.edu/coral/terms?issn=XXXX-XXXX"><em>http://coral.mylibrary.edu/coral/terms/?issn=XXXX-XXXX</em>.</a>
Using the Terms Tool requires some way for users to easily send this
type of ISSN/ISBN query. One option is to place a link to the Terms
Tool on the library’s openURL resolver menu. The template for the SFX
menu, for instance, can be edited in such a way as to create a link to
the Terms Tool which will dynamically use the ISSN and/or ISBN for the
specific resource being requested. The University of Notre Dame chose
this option and implemented the Terms Tool by placing the necessary
code in the footer of the SFX menu template. Similar options should
exist for the SerialsSolutions openURL resolver. A number of options
exist for how the Terms Tool could be implemented. It will be up to
each library to determine how they wish to create the necessary
ISSN/ISBN links.</p>

<p>Additional technical documentation for installing and implementing the
Terms Tool is available on the CORAL Documentation page. Please read
the technical documentation thoroughly as it explains additional
details and configuration options necessary for proper use of the
Terms Tool.</p>
