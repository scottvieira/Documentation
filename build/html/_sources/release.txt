Releasing a New Version of a Module
-----------------------------------

Before you release a new version of a CORAL module to the public, consider these tasks:

- Download the latest module code from the master branch on github
- Install and test in a fresh location (not on top of a previous version)
- Test the upgrade process (from the previous version to the latest code version)
- Ensure that all important features work, no bugs
- Make sure all appropriate release notes have been added for this new version
- Make sure all other related documents have been updated (especially installation / upgrade guides)
- Add a tag to preserve this version (this can be by adding a "release" via github, or by adding a tag to a local git repo then pushed to github with: git push --tags)
- Announce new version of module via listserv and website
- Create new milestone on github for next anticipated version of module (??)
