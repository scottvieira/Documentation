### About CORAL Licensing ###

 A component of Hesburgh Libraries locally developed ERM, CORAL
 Licensing provides a way to store and access digital copies of current
 and expired license agreements and related documents as well as
 associated agreement metadata. The licensing module helps make library
 license agreements more accessible to personnel through select
 searchable metadata fields and assists institutions in tracking and
 using specific pieces of information included in legal agreements.
 CORAL Licensing is a flexible document management system, useful in
 anticipating a variety of agreements and institutional goals for
 managing agreements. The module allows users to identify license
 clauses most important to record and track from an institutional point
 of view. With related features like a clause comparison function, and
 ILL and course pack terms tools that can be implemented to deliver
 terms through other systems such as SFX, the CORAL Licensing module
 provides a way to make better use of permissions included in the
 license agreement.

 *Please note that screenshots and text in this document are just
 examples and do not necessarily reflect terms for a particular
 resource.*

 ### Component Overview ###

 CORAL Licensing has six major components in the primary navigation at
 the top of each page.

 • Home

 • New License

 • Licenses in Progress

 • Expression Comparison

 • Terms Tool Report

 • Admin

### Home ###


 Search has been placed on the *Home* page as the primary point of
 entry into the license records. The search runs against the fields
 license name, document name, and publisher/provider. The fields are
 defined in the next section as we look at creating a new license
 record.

### New License

 Select *New License* from the main navigation to begin adding new
 license records. The link will present the window on the right.

 ‘License Name’ is the name of the license record. For example, a
 license record named *Cambridge University Press Journals* would
 contain any and all license documents pertaining to the Cambridge
 University Press journals.

 ‘Publisher/Provider’ is the name of the licensing organization. In
 this example Cambridge University Press would be the
 publisher/provider.

‘Consortium’ would be used when the licensed resources are obtained
through a consortium.

 The License Name may seem a bit arbitrary but it makes more sense when
 you think about a license record as a way to group together all
 licenses that are either related to each other or related to the same
 resource. Let us say for example that you have licensed a package of
 electronic journals from Springer and have over the years collected
 several licenses and amendments for that package. You can place all of
 those documents on the same license record and then you need to give
 the license record a name which gives some indication as to the
 documents found on that record. In this example ‘Springer Online
 Journals’ may be a valid license name.

 Let us also assume that you have licensed a set of eBooks from
 Springer as well and that the license for the eBook is in no way
 related to the license for the journals. You now have two options for
 loading the eBook license. You can create a new license record called
 *Springer eBooks* and load the license documents there or you can add
 the eBook license to the existing *Springer Online Journals* license.
 If you choose the latter then you could also consider changing the
 license name *Springer Online Journals to* something such as *Springer
 Online Products* to more accurately reflect all the documents
 contained on the record.

 *Interoperability note:* The publisher/provider field has an auto-fill
 feature which is populated from the organizations listed in CORAL
 Organizations. CORAL Licensing will manage publisher/provider names on
 its own if you have not installed CORAL Organizations or have disabled
 the interoperability. The publisher/provider names are managed and
 edited in the CORAL Licensing *Admin* area when the interoperability
 is disabled.

### Adding / Editing New License Record

 Here is a new license record which has just been created for
 *Cambridge University Press Online Journals*. To the right of the
 license name are the options to remove the license or to edit the
 name, publisher/provider and consortia. The publisher/provider name is
 hyperlinked and will take the user to the Cambridge University Press
 record within CORAL Organizations. Here you can also enter a license
 record status in the ‘License Status’ field to the far right of the
 license name. CORAL Licensing includes the following default statuses.

 License Status (definition)

 • Awaiting Document (license record created but scanned license not
 yet added)

 • Complete (license record is complete, no additional work required)

 • Document Only (document loaded with expressions not identified or
 loaded)

 • Editing Expressions (document loaded and currently adding license
 terms/expressions)

 • NLR (no license required)

 License Status values can be edited, added or deleted through the
 *Admin* section detailed later in this document. The default values
 are simply suggestions for how an institution might consider tracking
 agreements and to indicate the purpose of the field.

 The license record has four sections located on the left-hand column;
 Documents, Expressions, SFX Links and Attachments

### Documents

 The Documents tab contains all the documents for each license record.
 Any document may be uploaded to the system including licenses,
 amendments, order forms, purchase requests, or any other important
 document. Select ‘upload new document’ to begin.

### Adding New Documents

 The ‘upload new document’ link opens the window on the right. Here you
 can fill out the initial details of the document and upload the actual
 file. Document Name is the only required field.

‘Effective date’ is the effective date of the agreement, if identified
and available.

‘Document Type’ identifies what type of document this is (ex. Agreement,
amendment, order form, etc).

‘Parent’ identifies any parent document (ex. A parent document would be
assigned when uploading an amendment).

‘Name’ is the title of the document, usually taken directly from the
license document (ex. Cambridge University Press Site License
Agreement).

 ‘File’- browse and upload a scanned copy of the actual document.

 ‘Archived’ is used to identify documents which are no longer current
 or have been superseded by another agreement. Archived documents are
 sorted separate from current documents and are collapsed beneath a
 show/hide link to save screen space. Archiving a document does not
 delete it from the system. It also does not delete any expressions
 attached to that document.

 ‘Document Type’ is another customizable field which allows each
 library to set their own terminology. The software comes with the
 following types included.

     *Document Type*:
    
     • Agreement
    
     • Amendment
    
     • Countersigned Agreement
    
     • Internal Acknowledgement
    
     • Order Form
    
     • SERU

### Editing Documents

 Once added the documents will display on the Documents tab sorted
 first by Document Type (agreements sort together, order forms sort
 together, etc) and then by signature date with most recent first.
 Multiple signatures for both licensee and licensor can be added using
 the ‘add signatures’ link. On the right hand column are the links to
 view, edit, and delete each document. Now that the documents are
 loaded the next step is to begin adding expressions. Please note that
 Expressions are not required. You should however assign an appropriate
 License Status to the record that indicates it is a document only
 record.

### Adding Expressions

 The Expressions tab is where the expressions or clauses of the license
 are entered. You may enter any expression type that you wish. The
 software comes with the following expression types already defined but
 again the field is customizable and allows you to enter the types of
 your choice.

    Expression Type:
    
     • Authorized Users
    
     • Confidentiality Clause
    
     • Course Packs
    
     • eReserves
    
     • General Notes
    
     • Interlibrary Loan
    
     • Jurisdiction
    
     • Multi-year Term
    
     • Post Cancellation Access
    
     • Third Party Archiving


### Adding Expressions

 The ‘add new expression’ link opens the window on the right. From this
 window you can add expressions for the documents that have been
 previously loaded.

 ‘Document’ is the document name for which you want to add a new
 expression. The drop-down is pre-populated from the existing document
 names in the specific license record. This is a required field.

 ‘Expression Type’ is the type of expression you wish to add
 (interlibrary loan terms, course pack rights, etc). This is a required
 field.

 ‘Qualifier’ is another customizable field which can be used to qualify
 particular expressions. For example, a qualifier of *Permitted* or
 *Prohibited* may be appropriate for an Interlibrary Loan expression.
 You may choose to ignore this field or choose to use it in a different
 fashion for other expression types.

 ‘Document Text’ is for the actual text of the license clause. An
 interlibrary loan expression has been added in the following figure.

### Adding Display Notes

 In this example an Interlibrary Loan expression has been added along
 with a snippet of the license text and a qualifier of *Permitted* has
 been added noting that the item does allow for ILL. The

 actual legal text can be quite confusing so the next step is to add a
 Display Note which can hold an interpretation of the text of the
 clause that can be used for public display.

### Adding Display / Internal Notes

 The ‘add/view display notes’ link opens a window which allows you to
 enter multiple display notes. It also displays the Document Text on
 that same window so that you can refer back to it while adding the
 notes. The sort order of multiple display notes can also be adjusted
 through this same window. The following figure shows a completed
 Display Notes window.

 There are two types of expression notes in CORAL licensing; Display
 Notes and Internal Notes. You can set the note type to either Internal
 or Display for each expression type on the ‘Admin’ page detailed later
 in this document. The two note types (internal and display) were added
 so that a distinction could be made between expressions and notes that
 were intended to be displayed outside the module, for instance in one
 of the terms tools, and those that were for internal use only. The
 Display Notes which are intended to be shared have additional
 functionality built in that the Internal Notes lack. In the following
 figure you will see the completed interlibrary loan expression. In
 this example the Interlibrary Loan expression type has been set to use
 Display Notes and as such the expression is presented with an
 additional checkbox to the left of the Document Text. Internal Notes
 do not receive this checkbox. When the licensing librarian or other
 appropriate personnel has finished editing the notes and expression
 he/she can check this box which indicates that the expression is
 finished and it makes the expression available through the *Terms Tool
 Report* page. An email is then generated by the system indicating that
 a new expression has been completed and is ready for display. You can
 edit the recipients of this email in the *Admin* page.

 If you choose not to use the *Terms Tool Report* page you may turn it
 off as explained in the technical documentation guide. This will also
 remove the display note checkbox and email functionality. It will also
 remove the SFX Links tab which is explained next.

### Completed Expression

 The above figure is the completed expression with document text,
 qualifier and display notes. Qualifier may not be appropriate for
 certain expression types. The intended use of the qualifier is to
 further document permitted/prohibited distinctions such as
 interlibrary loan, course packs and ereserves. You may continue to add
 as many expressions as needed for some or all documents.

### SFX Links

 Once the expressions or terms of the license are known, the next
 question to ask is ‘Which journals are covered by these terms?’.
 That’s where the SFX Links tab comes into play. Using this tab it is
 possible to relate a specific license to the covered journals in a
 specific SFX target or package. In this example the Cambridge
 University Press Site License Agreement is being associated with the
 Cambridge Journals Online target in SFX (Cambridge Journals Online is
 the SFX target public name). This SFX – License connection allows for
 the delivery of license terms through the SFX menu as detailed in the
 Terms Tool User Guide. It is true that not every institution uses SFX.
 The SFX Links tab could be renamed and/or repurposed for use with
 other openurl resolvers or journal management systems. This

 tab is meant to be used in conjunction with the Terms Tool and can be
 disabled along with the *Terms Tool Report* page for those who do not
 wish to use it.

### Attachments

 For any resource there may be documents in addition to the actual
 license that are important to retain. Title lists and email
 correspondence are two that may be the most common. The Attachments
 tab allows you to upload these additional documents to the license
 record. The above figure shows an email that has been uploaded with
 the date and a description of the file. In this case the attachment is
 an email from the publisher detailing additional restrictions on the
 resource. The date field is not automatically entered by the system so
 it does not have to be the date the file was loaded into CORAL
 Licensing. The intention of the date field was to be the date the
 attached document was received but since the date is manually chosen
 it can be any date of your choice. The ‘view attachment 1’ link will
 open the uploaded file.

### Licenses in Progress

 The *Licenses in Progress* page will show the licenses that are not
 yet complete. It is intended to be used by the licensing staff as a
 queue of outstanding licenses. It has been coded to show licenses of
 status Awaiting Document or Editing Expressions and will also show new
 licenses which have not yet been given any status. The hyperlinked
 License Name will take you into the license record.

### Expression Comparison

 *Expression Comparison* allows the user to see all the instances of a
 specific expression type across all documents in a single screen or
 view. The 'Limit by Expression Type' dropdown allows the user to
 select from among all defined expression types. In the figure above
 the display notes and document text have been removed for reasons of
 confidentiality. In place of &lt; Display Notes removed &gt; and &lt;
 Document Text removed &gt; users would see the actual notes and
 document text that were entered. This allows licensing or relevant
 personnel to compare language for each expression type across all
 documents. It could be an immensely powerful tool when attempting to
 come up with recommended language during negotiations. The user may
 also add new display notes, open the license record and open the
 actual document from this page.

 *Expression Comparison* is intended for personnel that need quick
 access to all expressions in the system. Other library staff however,
 may only need access to specific types of expressions and this
 particular page may be information overload. The *Terms Tool Report*
 page was developed for these other users.

### Terms Tool Report

 Once again the notes and document text have been removed from the
 screenshot. *Terms Tool Report* provides access to only the
 expressions using display notes and which have been identified as
 being complete by the licensing librarian using the terms tool
 checkbox mentioned earlier. As such it will not display unfinished
 expressions which the licensing librarian may still be working on.
 Another difference between *Terms Tool Report* and *Expression
 Comparison* is that this page does not offer any links for editing the
 record. While similar in function to *Expression Comparison* this page
 was added in order to serve a user group which does not need the full
 access provided by the *Expression Comparison* page.

 The main points to remember for this page are that it displays
 expressions which use display notes but only those that have been
 approved for display. It is possible to turn off *Terms Tool Report*
 and hide it from display if you do not wish to use it. Turning off the
 *Terms Tool Report* will also disable the SFX Links tab on the license
 record as well as the terms tool checkbox used to indicate that a
 Display Note has been completed and approved for display. Please see
 the Terms Tool User Guide for more information on how *Terms Tool
 Report* can be used and on how it can be used to push out license
 terms to other systems.

### Admin

 The *Admin* page is where you will edit Expression Types, Document
 Types, Signature Types and

 License Statuses. Each of these fields can have as many values as
 needed so that the system can better

 meet local needs. *Admin* is also where you will edit and manage user
 permissions. CORAL Licensing has been built with the ability to limit
 access to select individuals given the confidential nature of license
 agreements. Users may not access CORAL Licensing until they are first
 set up with an account by an administrator. The following figure shows
 the ‘add new user’ window available from the *Admin* page.

 ‘Login ID’ will be the user’s unique ID in your local campus
 authentication system. See the technical documentation for more
 details on authentication.

 ‘Privilege’ is the user’s level of access (i.e. read only, etc).

 ‘Terms Tool Email’ – Enter email address if you wish the user to
 receive email notification when the terms tool box is checked for a
 given expression. Leave this blank for all others.

 The values available in the Privilege field deserve further
 explanation.

 Privileges

 • Admin users have complete add/edit rights and can remove licenses
 and associated fields.

 Access to the *Admin* page, the SFX Links tab on the license record
 and the terms tool checkbox is restricted to users with Admin
 privileges.

 • Add/Edit users can add, edit, or remove licenses and associated
 fields.

 • View Only users can view all license information and are allowed
 access to the uploaded documents.

 • Restricted users can view all license information but are not
 allowed access to the uploaded documents.

 Admin, Add/Edit and View Only are the same privileges used in the
 other CORAL modules. Restricted is an extra privilege used only in
 CORAL Licensing in order to restrict access to the actual license
 agreements that have been uploaded to the system.
