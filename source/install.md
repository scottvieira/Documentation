Installing CORAL
----------------

### Installation 
Installation can occur in one of two ways â€“ either through the web installation script or manually.  For a manual installation see [Installing CORAL Manually](http://docs.coral-erm.org/en/latest/manual.html).  The web 
installation will provide advantages over manual installation because it will check MySQL privileges and PHP version and directory permissions.

#### Installing CORAL 2.0

Note: For upgrading to CORAL 2.0 see the following section [Upgrading to CORAL](http://docs.coral-erm.org/en/latest/install.html#upgrading-to-coral)

New to CORAL 2.0 is the Unified Installer which simplifies the web installation.

Step 1: Download a copy of the [latest version at Github](https://github.com/Coral-erm/Coral/releases).

Step 2: If you use the option to download the compressed zipped file, expand this file in a working folder.

Step 3: Copy the expanded folder to your webserver.  If using Apache, this would be something like /var/www/html/ folder.  If CORAL will be in a sub folder on your webserver, change the folder name from "Coral-master" to, for example, "coral" or what name you choose.

The web installation depends upon the index.php file found in the coral folder.  Your Apache settings should be set to include loading the index.php file.  

Step 4: Go to the home directory via a web browser to initiate the United Installer script.  

You should see the following.

![Screenshot of Unified Installer](img/install/installUnifiedInstaller.png)

Step 5: All the modules are selected by default.  De-select any modules not required for your installation and then click the "Continue Installing" button.

Step 6: Follow the instructions for any messages received.

For example, you may receive a message asking to change the folder and file permissions similar to the following.

![Screenshot of Instructions for using chmod command to change file and folder permissions](img/install/installInstructions.png)


For example, to correct the file and folder permissions in Linux you would do something similar to the this via your terminal.  Be sure to to run these commands in your Coral folder on the web server.

For example, for Ubuntu Linux you would have something similar to the following.  


    sudo chmod 777 common

    sudo chmod 777 auth/admin 

... and so on.

When finished changing the permissions, click on "Try Again" button to continue the installation.

Step 7: Following this you should see the following, setup CORAL with your MySQL.  Generally, this will be user root or an user that has the necessary privileges (i.e., select, insert, update, 
delete, and create table privileges). This user will not be remembered after the installation since part of the process is to create a new user for CORAL to use in day to day operation. 
However, if you don't want to give the installer user credentials with create database permissions, you can provide one with permission only for specific databases, but you will need to manually create a database for each module and use the Advance MySQL Database Setup form to provide the database names to the installer. After providing the necessary information click the "Continue Installing" button. 

![Screenshot of MySQL Database Setup](img/install/installDatabaseSetup.png)


Optional - Advance MySQL Database Setup form as seen below will allow you to customize your database names.

![Screenshot of MySQL Database Setup Advanced](img/install/installDatabaseSetupAdvanced.png)


Step 8: Setup a regular database user.  As noted this user will need SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges. If the MySQL username you already gave CORAL has permission to create a new user it will create the name and password you provide here. Otherwise you will need to provide a username and password that you have manually configured in the database already. When finished adding the username and password click the "Continue Installing" button. 

![Screenshot of Database User Setup](img/install/installDatabaseUserSetup.png)


Step 9: Setup default user.  This account will be used to administer other users and features in CORAL.

![Screenshot of Default User Setup](img/install/installSetupDefaultUser.png)


Step 10: Setup for Auth Module.  This includes setting up the session timeout and the whether or not to use [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) for authentication.  The session timeout represents seconds.  When finished click the "Continue Installing" button.

![Screenshot of Default User Setup](img/install/installSetupAuthModule.png)

Step 11: If not using LDAP, setup an admin password for the Auth Module.  Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.

![Screenshot of Default User Setup](img/install/installAuthPasswordSetup.png)


Step 12: Choose whether or not to use the [Terms Tool](http://docs.coral-erm.org/en/latest/terms.html) functionality.

![Screenshot of Terms Tool Setup](img/install/installTermsTool.png)


Step 13: Setup Link Resolver Base URL and Outlier Flagging Feature

![Screenshot of Link Resolver Base URL and Outlier Flagging setup](img/install/installLinkResolver.png)

The Link Resolver Base URL provides a quick way to view complete holdings from within the Usage Module.  Likewise, the Outlier Flagging is used in the Usage Module to help flag imported usage data that appears incorrect.  See the [Usage Statistics Guide](http://docs.coral-erm.org/en/latest/usagestats.html) for more information.

Again, click the "Continue Installing" button when finished. 

Step 14: Setup Resources Module

![Screenshot of setup for Resources Module](img/install/installResourcesModuleSetup.png)

Step 15: As instructed update your file permissions for better security.

![Screenshot of Instructions for using chmod command to change file and folder permissions](img/install/installProtectFiles.png)

When finished updating click on the "Try Again" button.

When finished you should briefly see a message indicating what modules have been successfully installed.  The message will redirect to the CORAL home page in 10 seconds.

#### Upgrading to CORAL

Note: To upgrade to CORAL 2.0 and following you need to be sure all your modules are updated to the latest 1.x versions.  Before starting any upgrade process make a backup of your previous CORAL installation and data.

**Installation Notes:**
* There is a separate install for each 1.x module
* The CORAL-Main module does not have an installation script. You simply need to copy the module files into the parent `/coral/` folder.
* If you need to re-run the installation for any reason, you can do so **but it will remove any data in the 
database and reset to original data load!** 
* Be sure to remove the `/install/` directory once installation is complete.

##### Steps for Upgrading to the latest 1.x versions

**Auth Module**

Step 1: [Download the latest 1.x Auth Module (v.1.1.1)](https://github.com/ndlibersa/auth/archive/v1.1.1.zip) and unzip the file into a webserver folder.

Step 2: Copy the `configuration.ini` file from the `admin` folder of your current Auth module into the `admin` folder of the latest Auth module.  

**PLEASE NOTE: For all the following steps "latest ... module" refers to your expanded download of the latest version of CORAL that you are upgrading to.**

Your Auth module should now be upgraded to the latest version of CORAL 1.x

**Resources Module**

Step 1: [Download the latest 1.x Resources Module (v1.4.1)](https://github.com/ndlibersa/resources/archive/v1.4.1.zip) and unzip the file into a webserver folder.

**Reports Module**

Presently, v.1.0.0 is the only version of the Reports module, so there is no need to upgrade this module.

-----

Once you have updated all your existing modules to the latest 1.x version you are ready to start the CORAL 2.0 upgrade.

Step 9: Download a copy of the [latest version at Github](https://github.com/Coral-erm/Coral/releases).

Step 10: If you use the option to download the compressed zipped file, expand this file in a working folder.

Step 11: Copy the expanded folder to your webserver.  If using Apache, this would be something like /var/www/html/ folder.  If CORAL will be in a sub folder on your webserver, change the folder name from "Coral-master" to, for example, "coral" or what name you choose.

The web installation depends upon the index.php file found in the coral folder.  Your Apache settings should be set to include loading the index.php file.  

Step 12: Similar to the upgrade process, move your current `configuration.ini` files found under the `/admin` folders of the version of CORAL you just upgraded into the appropriate `/admin` folders under the new copy of CORAL.  You will need to do this for all the modules you are updating.  

The following is a list of modules applicable:

Auth

Licensing

Management

Organizations

Reports

Resources

Usage

Note: If you want to add a new module to the upgrade, create a new `configuration.ini` under the module's respective `/admin` folder.  Fill out the appropriate settings, such as the CORAL MySQL login info, module database names, URLs, etc.  For a more in-depth description of the `configuration.ini` settings see [Installing CORAL Manually](http://docs.coral-erm.org/en/latest/manual.html)

When finished updating the `configuration.ini` file under all the applicable `/admin` module folders for the new version of CORAL, you are now ready to start the unified installer script.

Step 13: Go to the home directory for the new version of CORAL via a web browser to initiate the United Installer script.  

Using our example folder above, you may have something similar to the following `http://localhost/Coral-master/`.
As long as your Apache server is setup to read by default the `index.php` file, the installation process will start.   

You should see the following.

![Screenshot of Pre-installation Check](img/install/installUpgradePreviousVersion.png)

Step 13: Click the "CORAL ALREADY INSTALLED (UPGRADE/REPAIR)" button. 

Following this, you should see the unified installer modules to use list.  

![Screenshot of Unified Installer](img/install/installUnifiedInstaller.png)

Step 14: All the modules are selected by default.  De-select any modules not required for your installation and then click the "Continue Installing" button.  Remember you should only be selecting modules that you modified the `configuration.ini` for according to Step 12.

Step 15: Follow the instructions for any messages received.

For example, you may receive a message asking to change the folder and file permissions similar to the following.

![Screenshot of Instructions for using chmod command to change file and folder permissions](img/install/installUpgradeFilePermissions.png)

Update the appropriate permissions on your folders and then proceed with the installation by clicking on "TRY AGAIN."

You should receive the following.

![Screenshot of Instructions to protect your configuration.ini file](img/install/installCheckingProtectedFiles.png)

Again, update your permissions to lock your `configuration.ini` file again and click on "TRY AGAIN."

Once finished, you should see the successfully upgraded CORAL 2.0 message before being redirected to the CORAL homepage.
